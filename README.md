**This program is an attempt to determine how fast is a given computer.** 
<ol>
<li>This program initialises a variable to 0 and subsequently increments it in steps of 1 via a loop. When 1s has elapsed post the initialisation, it ends the thread, marks the time and prints the value of the variable.</li> 
<li>Greater the value of the variable, greater is the processing speed.</li>
<li>This program incorporates multi-threading, libraries such as time, threading and sys. When executed, the output contains the time and value of the variable at that instant.</li> 
</ol>
<h5>Here, it is important to note that due to thread switching, output may change with every run. It is recommended to run the program multiple times. Here, kindly try to execute the .py file in python IDLE for best results. Here, the executable file may pose certain issues so it is recommeneded to run using the .py file.</h5>
