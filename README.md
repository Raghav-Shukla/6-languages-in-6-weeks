**This program is an attempt to determine how fast is a given computer.** 
<ol>
<li>This program initialises a variable to 0 and subsequently increments it in steps of 1 via a loop. When 1s has elapsed post the initialisation, it ends the thread, marks the time and prints the value of the variable.</li> 
<li>Greater the value of the variable, greater is the processing speed.</li>
<li>This program incorporates multi-threading, libraries such as time, threading and sys. When executed, the output contains the time and value of the variable at that instant.</li> 
  </ol>
